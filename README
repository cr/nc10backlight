nc10backlight 0.1 - backlight workaround
by cr at 23 bit dot net
Licensed under GPLv2


Sets backlight level via PCI registers on Samsung NC10. It is inteded as work-around
for dysfunctional xbacklight, for example on Fedora 11 without the nomodeset Kernel
parameter. You cannot use nomodeset if you run Compiz, for example, because it
requires GEM which is disabled by nomodeset. The nc10backlight requires root
privileges and is installed as suid root binary.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Later Linux kernels contain a fix for the problem, so consider the backlight
issue solved and this tool obsolete. I uploaded it as an example on raw Linux PCI
register programming in the hopes that someone finds this useful.

Disclaimer:
	USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! This program writes directly to PCI
	registers, so IT MIGHT DAMAGE YOUR HARDWARE. It might run
	fine on other Intel Atom hardware with Mobile 94xGx, but the
	current version is hardcoded to the Samsung NC10. The checks
	might fail, so don't try to run it on different hardware.

Installation:
	sudo yum install libpciaccess-devel
	tar zxf nc10backlight*.tgz
	cd nc10backlight-*
	make
	sudo make install

Usage:
	print current level: nc10brightness
	set maximum level: nc10brightness -set 255
	decrease by 20: nc10brightness - 20
	usage info: nc10brightness -h

Key bindings (optional):
	Just to give you an example...
	for Gnome/Metacity:
		in gconf-editor
		- add /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/run_command_5: "<Control>Up"
		- add /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/run_command_6: "<Control>Down"
		- add /apps/metacity/keybindings_commands/run_command_5: "nc10backlight -inc 17"
		- add /apps/metacity/keybindings_commands/run_command_6: "nc10backlight -dec 17"
	for Gnome/Compiz
		in gconf-editor
		- add /apps/compiz/genera/allscreens/options/run_command5_key: "<Control>Up"
		- add /apps/compiz/genera/allscreens/options/run_command6_key: "<Control>Down"
		- add /apps/compiz/genera/allscreens/options/command5: "nc10backlight -inc 17"
		- add /apps/compiz/genera/allscreens/options/command6: "nc10backlight -dec 17"
